# resistor-goal-seek

Enter the desired equivalent resistance.
Enter the resistances of resistors you have.
The program will output the closest possible equivalent resistance as well as the configuration required.

s represents the resistors within the parenthesis should be put in series.
p represents the resistors within the parenthesis should be put in parallel. Follow order of operations.

constantly updating code to be more efficient and include the ability to add more resistors
